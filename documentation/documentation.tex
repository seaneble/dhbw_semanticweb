\begin{abstract}
We created a web interface that enables users to list and find data from a set of films and associated information. This data is stored within a server that the interface communicates with.

One part of the project was to find suitable data from public sources and store this in a format that can be understood by semantic frameworks such as Jena. We configured this software in an appropriate way so that it is able to read the stored data and provide this to other systems.

In a second step we designed and created a small web application that uses an API of the software from step one to fetch data from the server. The user can conduct simple search operations in that application which in turn communicates with the server API in order to find matching data.
