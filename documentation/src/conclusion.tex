\section{Conclusion}
We were able to create a semantic search website through which users can navigate data and make queries at their leisure.

The data is stored in a Fuseki server instance and queried by a PHP script via the RESTful API of Fuseki.

All data is structured in accordance with the publicly available Movie Ontology. A set of sample data was loaded into Fuseki for example queries, yet storing all existing movies, genres, actors and their relationships would be possible, though complicated.
